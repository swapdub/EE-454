### Project 0 : Image Processing Pipeline
The aim of this project is:
<ul> 
  <li> Read an image file </li> 
  <li> Extract data regarding each pixel value</li> 
  <li> Transform the extracted data </li> 
  <li> Re-create image with different filters such as:
    <ul>
      <li> Blur</li>
      <li> Padded image</li>
      <li> Scaled image</li>
      <li> Smooth/Sharpen images</li>
      <li> Color effects</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
  <br>
  
  Although such a feature already exists in open libraries of languages such as Python. The goal of the project is to learn implementing these algorithm without using pre-made libraries.

### Project 1 : Image Filtering and Hough Transforms
The aim of this project is:
<ul> 
  <li> Filter out relevant data from an image. </li> 
  <li> By applying Hough Transforms algorithm on our images we are able to successfully detect and identify edges in the given sample images. </li>
</ul>

### Project 2 : Camera Projections using 2 cameras with known seperation
The aim of this project is:
<ul> 
  <li> Project 3D points to a 2D image</li> 
  <li> Map 2D points to 3D</li>
</ul>
  <br>
  
By using data from multiple frames, we were able to calculate and therefore track the location of our subject in a 3 dimensional world. The subject of the image could then be edited and an overlay was projected onto to 2 dimensional frame while maintaining their perpective in 3 dimensions.
